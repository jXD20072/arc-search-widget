## Installation
Simply download and install the .apk file from the latest release!

Once installed, you can add it to your home screen by selecting it in the widget drawer.

## Notes
* Currently, it just opens Arc Search (it doesn't automatically open the search window). This is a planned feature and I'm actively searching for ways to do it. That being said, PRs are welcome!
